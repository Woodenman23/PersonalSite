 In order to reduce thinking time during a yoga practice I designed a tkinter app which automatically chooses a sequence of poses.

It will then display images of each pose, with their names, for a set number of seconds, before moving on to the next pose in the sequence.

The sequence will always end with Shavasana "corpse pose" which relaxes the body and allows one to recover from the practice.
