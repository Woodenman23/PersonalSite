# PersonalSite

This is my site.

## Installation

It can be invoked my cloning the repo and then typing:
`Flask run`
into the terminal from the project's root directory.

(You will need Flask).

## Development

Soon I hope to have some javascript/react bits on the front end
and sort out the backend with a working database that stores the
user info.
